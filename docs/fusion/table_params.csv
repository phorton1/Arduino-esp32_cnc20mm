__________TABLE_BASICS_____________,,0

table_width,			in,		62 in,				front to back in design, which is side to side in place
table_length,			in,		62 in,				side to to side in design, which is front to back in place
table_height,			in,		29 in,				floor to top "3/4" plywood fixed top on which the runners ride

by1,					in,		0.75 in,			actual thickness of "1 by x" lumber
by2,					in,		1.5 in,				actual thickness of "2 by x" lumber
by4,					in,		3.5 in,				actual thickness of "4 by x" lumber
by6,					in,		5.5 in,				actual width of a "1 x 6"
by8,					in,		7.5 in,				actual width of a "1 x 6"

ply_thick,				mm,		17 mm,				thickness of "3/4" plywood
ply_medium,				mm,		11.5 mm,			thickness of "1/2" plywood

num_joists,				,		3,													three joists inside the frame
table_space,			in,		table_width - (num_joists + 2) * by2,				total open space to be divided
joist_space,			in,		table_space / (num_joists + 1),						space between joist faces CALCULATED 13.625
joist_spacing,			in,		joist_space + by2,									center to center joists CALCULATED 15.125

,the waste board is just 'known' for a this design
,it is 48" by the length of the table, flush up against the front runner

waste_width,			in, 	48 in


_________TABLE_LEGS________________,,0


, the table does NOT sit on the leg supports.
, they are purpously 1/8" below the table top,
, and at a 45 degree angle.

leg_tolerance,			in,		0.125 in,							space between leg supports and table top
by4_length,				in,		28.25 in,							length of 4x4's to get very close to 29" to work top


, thus far all table dimensions are nice fractions of an inch.
, the angled table supports, however, need to fit in a precise way
, and do not, in the design, come out to a nice fraction of inch.
, in construction they are rounded to a 1/16th of inch.

by4_hypotenuse,			in,		sqrt(by4 * by4 + by4 * by4),		length of hypotenuse of a 45 degree cut in a "2x4" CALCULATED 4.95

, now we calculate the inner and outer lengths of the support 2x4
, as the small_hypotenuse and big_hypotenuse

small_triangle_base,	in,		joist_space - by4,							the "base" of the smaller right triangle 			CALCULATED 10.125
small_hypotenuse,		in,		sqrt(small_triangle_base * small_triangle_base + small_triangle_base * small_triangle_base),	CALCULATED 14.319
big_triangle_base,		in,		small_triangle_base + by4_hypotenuse,		the "base" of the bigger right triangle				CALCULATED 15.075
big_hypotenuse,			in,		sqrt(big_triangle_base * big_triangle_base + big_triangle_base * big_triangle_base),			CALCULATED 21.319

, and we start the two lines for the 2x4 on the 4by4 DOWN fROM THE frame_top

leg_support_start,		in,	small_triangle_base + leg_tolerance,	CALCULATED 10.25
