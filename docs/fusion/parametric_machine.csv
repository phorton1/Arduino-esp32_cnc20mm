, Parameterized CNC Machine
,-------------------------------------------------------
, This is a design based on a few parameters that will automatically
, generate a reasonable machine, and one that, for a specific set of
, parameters, will produce the design for my existing machine.
,
, This design does NOT include the table.   The goal is to layout the
, active elements of the design and provide working statistics.  The
, specific design will then be imported to another design to create
, the overall machine including the table.


________PARAMS______________,,0
, The parameters in this section are the most important modifiable parameters.
, The origin of the design will be the left center of the front x-tube at the base
, of the x_stops (the top of the 'runner')

x_tube_length,			mm,		1552.1 mm,		from corrected original design
y_tube_length,			mm,		1505.5 mm,		from original design


________DESIGN_______________,,0
, This section includes design decisions in this model that are more or less fixed

tube_diameter,			mm,		20 mm,			idealized diameter of SS tubes; actual components are designed to specific tubes
x_sled_margin,			mm,		10 mm,			designed space between face of left x_stop and the x-sled in its nominal zero position
y_sled_margin,			mm,		7 mm,			designed space between face of x_sled and edge of y_sled
y_tube_extend,			mm,		27.8 mm,		how far y tubes stick out past center of x-tubes from original design


________FIXED_______________,,0
, The parameters in this section are 'fixed' by the design of other components,

x_tube_height,			mm,		40 mm,			from origin to center of x_tube as determined by X_SUPPORT design
x_support_width,		mm,		30 mm,			from X_SUPPORT design
x_stop_depth,			mm,		35 mm,			how far tubes go into x_ends as determined by X_ENDS design

x_sled_width,			mm,		46 mm, 			distance between inner and outer faces, from X_SLED design
x_sled_length,			mm,		180 mm,	 		from X_SLED design
y_sled_length,			mm,		142 mm,			from Y_SLED design

x_edge_to_ytube_x,		mm,		93 mm,			back edge of the x_sled to the center of the y_tubes from X_SLED design
y_edge_to_spindle_y,	mm,		71 mm,			along the y axis from Y_SLED design
y_edge_to_spindle_x,	mm,		123.50 mm,		along the x_axis from Y_SLED design
laser_offset_x,			mm,		13.90 mm,		from center of spindle to center of lase from Y_SLED design


_______CALCULATED_______________,,0
, Calculated values used in this model

x_tube_c2c,mm,			y_tube_length - 2 * y_tube_extend,   center-to-center CALCULATED 1449.90 same as old design

num_x_supports,			,		4,																number of x-supports per side from original design
x_tube_space,			mm,     x_tube_length - (2 * x_stop_depth) - (num_x_supports * x_support_width),	amount of space to split up
x_support_space,		mm,		x_tube_space / (num_x_supports + 1),							face to face space between supports, CALCULATED 272.42
x_support_spacing,		mm,		x_support_space + x_support_width,								the rect pattern spacing includes the previous one's width CALCULATED 302.24
x_support_first, 		mm,		x_stop_depth + x_support_spacing - x_support_width,				the first one from origin includs the x_stop, but not a support CALCULATED 307.42

, We need an expression for how far from the end of the y-tube the Y_SLED should be.
, This is based on getting BACK to the the x-tube center with y_tube_extend, then
, getting to the face of the X_SLED with it's width, and then adding the desired 7mm offset

y_sled_offset,			mm,		y_tube_extend + (x_sled_width / 2) + y_sled_margin,				y-sled at nominal zero from the end of the y-tube CALCULATED 57.80


_________________TRAVEL__________________,,0
, Parameters merely used to show the resultant work area in a sketch

y_travel,				mm,		y_tube_length - y_sled_length - 2 * y_sled_offset,					CALCULATED 1247.90 same as old design
x_travel,				mm,		x_tube_length - x_sled_length - 2 * (x_stop_depth + x_sled_margin),	CALCULATED 1282.10 same as old design

, to DRAW the work area, we just determine the spindle offset from the origin

spindle_offset_x,		mm,		x_stop_depth + x_sled_margin + x_edge_to_ytube_x + y_edge_to_spindle_x
spindle_offset_y,		mm,		(x_sled_width / 2) + y_sled_margin + y_edge_to_spindle_y


__________________CONVERSIONS________________,,0
, convert various values to rounded inches for display as text inches in a sketch
, we have to first convert to dimensionless inches, then mul * 100,
, then divide by 100

x_tube_inches,			in,		( round(( x_tube_length / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
y_tube_inches,			in,		( round(( y_tube_length / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
x_c2c_inches,			in,		( round(( x_tube_c2c / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
x_travel_inches,		in,		( round(( x_travel / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
y_travel_inches,		in,		( round(( y_travel / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
first_support_in,		in,		( round(( x_support_first / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in
