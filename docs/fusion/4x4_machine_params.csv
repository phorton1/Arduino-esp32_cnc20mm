, Parameterized CNC Machine
,-------------------------------------------------------
, This is a design based on a few parameters that will automatically
, generate a reasonable machine, and one that, for a specific set of
, parameters, will produce the design for my existing machine.
,
, This design does NOT include the table.   The goal is to layout the
, active elements of the design and provide working statistics.  The
, specific design will then be imported to another design to create
, the overall machine including the table.

x_support_first, 		mm,		x_end_depth + x_support_spacing - x_support_width,				the first one from origin includs the x_stop, but not a support CALCULATED 307.42

, We need an expression for how far from the end of the y-tube the Y_SLED should be.
, This is based on getting BACK to the the x-tube center with y_tube_extend, then
, getting to the face of the X_SLED with it's width, and then adding the desired 7mm offset

y_sled_offset,			mm,		y_tube_extend + (x_sled_width / 2) + y_sled_margin,				y-sled at nominal zero from the end of the y-tube CALCULATED 57.80

x_travel,				mm,		x_tube_length - x_sled_length - 2 * (x_end_depth + x_sled_margin),	CALCULATED 1282.10 same as old design

, to DRAW the work area, we just determine the spindle offset from the origin

spindle_offset_x,		mm,		x_end_depth + x_sled_margin + x_edge_to_ytube_x + y_edge_to_spindle_x
spindle_offset_y,		mm,		(x_sled_width / 2) + y_sled_margin + y_edge_to_spindle_y


__________CONVERSIONS________________,,0
, convert various values to rounded inches for display as text inches in a sketch
, we have to first convert to dimensionless inches, then mul * 100,
, then divide by 100

y_travel_inches,		in,		( round(( y_travel / 25.4 mm ) * 100) / 100 ) * 1 in

___________ACCESSORIES_______________,,0

, the drag chains are positioned during their placement, and then the fixed end is grounded,
, and the other end is moved, as best as possible, to connect to the moving part.  These
, are the most important parameters, but slight movements of components, including moving
, the axes to intermediate position, are made to get things to work.  At the end the
, axes are returned to their 'zero' positions and the model is saved.

, starting positions

x_drag_offset,			mm,		735 mm,			distance from left edge of runner to end of fixed end of x drag chain
x_drag_inset,			mm,		0.5 mm,			inset from front edge of runner to centered on drag_bracket
y_drag_offset,			mm,		110 mm,			distance from front edge of drag_ply to start of fixed end of y drag chain
y_drag_inset,			mm,		8.85 mm,		inset from edge of drag ply to wood y-drag_support on top of y axis

, ending positions, trying to pre-bend chains so that they are in correct place when imported
, note the use off offets from the WOOD.

x_drag_height,			mm,		164.7 mm,		from top of runner to bottom of x drag_bracket
x_drag_end,				mm,		86.35 mm,		from left edge of runner to end of upper (female) drag end

y_drag_height,			mm,		128.077 mm,		fron top of drag_ply to bottom of y-axis drag wood piece
y_drag_end,				mm,		161.0 mm,		from front edge of drag ply to front edge of y-axis drag wood piece


, so, for example, the inverted x drag chain moving end ends up  164.7 mm ABOVE and (735 - 86.35 mm) TO THE LEFT OF the end of the fixed end
, and the inverted y chain moving end ends up 128.077 mm ABOVE and (161.10 - 110 mm) TO THE "LEFT" of the fixed end
, these params are manually entered into the DRAG25 and DRAG45 models.
